        <p>I am Douglas, a professional with extensive experience in management, teaching, and software development. I was born in Congonhas, a small town in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and studied in public schools, building my career with ethics, a results-driven mindset, and a passion for innovation. Since my teenage years, technology has sparked my interest, leading me to start my career at the age of 16 by testing software to identify issues related to the Y2K bug.</p>
        <p>With a solid academic and practical foundation, I dedicated 10 years to the information technology sector and 15 years to teaching IT and business, covering undergraduate, postgraduate, and masterâ€™s research programs. My journey has also included nearly 20 years of leading teams and projects. In the IT sector, I managed technical support, software testing, and usability teams. In higher education, I served for over a decade as dean and vice dean of undergraduate studies at two major universities.</p>
        <p>Now, in a natural return to my technological roots, I am focused on applying my expertise in the tech industry. My goal is to collaborate on creating innovative, robust, and scalable solutions by combining strategic vision, technical skills, and a passion for continuous learning.</p>
        <p>In 2024, I completed dozens of courses to stay updated on the state-of-the-art in IT, deepening my knowledge in new programming languages, relational and NoSQL databases, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Back in the technology field, I dedicated myself to creating practical software development courses for Descomplica University and Afya/UNIGRANRIO University, including Database Tuning, Applied Computational Thinking, Software Design, and Software Design Patterns.</p>
        <p>To solidify my career transition, I am seeking a position as a software engineer. My objective is to apply my skills to challenging projects, continually enhance my technical and practical expertise, and build a solid and consistent trajectory as a developer.</p>
